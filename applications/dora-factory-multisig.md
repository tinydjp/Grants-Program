# Multisig Pallet

* **Project Name:** Build A Minimum Viable Functioning Multisig Product on Substrate
* **Team Name:** Dora Factory

## Project Overview

Multisig is the mostly used DAO infrastructure so far. In the Ethereum ecosystem, multisig wallets are hosting major DAOs (such as venture DAOs & grant DAOs). This project implements a multisig pallet and a minimum viable functioning multisig product on a Substrate. The goal of this project is to eventually launch a multisig product that is integrated with Dora Factory's testnets and parachain.


### Project Details 

The MultiSig Substrate pallet will implement features including the following:
- Create wallet by organization
- Multi-asset management
- Initiate a transaction in a wallet, sign a transaction, confirm a transaction
- Add a signer, update multisig rule

There've been a multisig pallet developed by parity. The pallet (https://libraries.io/cargo/pallet-multisig) is a basic building block for us to build a more complete multisig MVP to meet actual demands of DAOs. It should also become an open-source module for us and other developers to build more complicated multisig features in the future. The reasons why build a new pallet are below

1. Multisig pallet only provides 3 methods, which can not meet requirements application-level and DAO use cases
2. The multisig pallet has not been updated for a while, weâ€™ll implement more new features to help community to build a multisig pallet faster
3. The latest polkadot{.js} has removed feautres to support multisig, which makes this pallet hard to debug/demonstrate
4. As Dora Factory is working on DAO infrastructures, most of our users are organization users, we are creating a multisig for organization users (e.g. a DAO can deposit and manage funding using the pallet and get access to a broader range of applications from Dora Factory). In this way this pallet can integrate with other Dora Factory pallets seamlessly.

Besides, in this grant, we'll implement a frontend MVP to make the multisig work for end users.

### Ecosystem Fit 

The Dora Factory team has built the first functioning quadratic funding pallet, a MolochDAO pallet (for both MolochDAO v1 & v2), and a POA local testnet that runs an actual quadratic funding round for Dora Factory ecosystem projects (https://hackerlink.io/grant/dora-factory/).

In addition to the pallets, the Dora Factory team has also built up the parachain infrastructure with a core pallet that helps organizations register and use future pallets that are available on the Dora Factory parachain.

Although structures vary in different organizations, funding management is a general demand of all decentralized organizations. Multisig has been proven to be the most general and flexible way of managing funds within a DAO (or any other forms of decentralized organizations / communities), because it introduces minimum procedure requirements of funding management except multi-signature itself. Therefore it is also the best entry point to a wider range of dGov applications.

### Team members
* Dora Factory & DoraHacks Dev Community -- a community of developers who has built HackerLink.io/en, now hosting quadratic funding grants, bounties, and hackathons for EVM ecosystems, Polygon, BSC, Filecoin, Solana, and Dora Factory itself (https://hackerlink.io/grant/dora-factory/). The team also implemented a quadratic funding Substrate pallet (https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/104), a Moloch pallet, and a DAO-as-a-Service Substrate chain to host dGov applications within the Polkadot / Substrate ecosystem.

## Future Plans

Integrate the multisig MVP with the Dora Factory core pallet and allow any organization on the Dora Factory Substrate chain to create a multisig wallet and use it to manage funds and access the other dGov applications (e.g. Quadratic Funding, MolochDAO, etc.) in the ecosystem.
